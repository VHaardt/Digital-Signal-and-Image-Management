Here you will find all the materials used to create the project. Below is a brief overview of the available notebooks and folders:

Notebooks:
-Mono-dimensional.ipynb: code for training and testing mono-dimensional models for audio
-Bi-dimensional.ipynb: code for training and testing on bi-dimensional models for RGB image
-Bi-dimensional_edges.ipynb: code for training and testing on bi-dimensional models for edges image
-StartGAN.ipynb: code for GAN model
-Demo.ipynb: code for demo

Folders:
-Data: contains the datasets, audio and images used for training and testing.
-Models: contains the saved models.
-stargan: contains 4 subfolders.
	-samples: contains train results every 1000 iterations
	-results: contains test results
	-models: contains model checkpoints.
	-logs: for debug

Also there is the presentation called "Presentation_Digital.pdf" and the video of the demo called "Video_Demo.mp4"
